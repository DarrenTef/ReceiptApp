Running your React Native application

Step 1: Start Metro

Metro is the javascript build tool for React Native. To start the Metro development server, run the following from your project folder:

	npm start
	



Step 2: Start your application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

	npm run android
	
This is one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.


That's it!
