Installing dependencies

You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.




OPTIONAL: Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

It manages node installations for Windows. Not required for this project, but might help you in the future.

https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

Then type: nvm install 21.7.3




Install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK)

You can either install Chocolately (another package manager) or download it directly

Chocolately: https://chocolatey.org/install

choco install -y microsoft-openjdk17

Or

Directly: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-17




Install Android Studio

https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

    Android SDK
    Android SDK Platform
    Android Virtual Device
    If you are not already using Hyper-V: Performance (Intel ® HAXM) (See here for AMD or Hyper-V)

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.




Install Android SDK

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 14 (UpsideDownCake) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 14 (UpsideDownCake) entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

    Android SDK Platform 34
    Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the Android SDK Build-Tools entry, then make sure that 34.0.0 is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.




Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

    Open the Windows Control Panel.
    Click on User Accounts, then click User Accounts again
    Click on Change my environment variables
    Click on New... to create a new ANDROID_HOME user variable that points to the path to your Android SDK:
	
The SDK is installed, by default, at the following location:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk

You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under Languages & Frameworks → Android SDK.




Add platform-tools to Path

    Open the Windows Control Panel.
    Click on User Accounts, then click User Accounts again
    Click on Change my environment variables
    Select the Path variable.
    Click Edit.
    Click New and add the path to platform-tools to the list.

The default location for this folder is:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
